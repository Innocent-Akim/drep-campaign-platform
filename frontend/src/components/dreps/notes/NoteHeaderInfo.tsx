        The shortfall, according to the ICCO, is attributed to an anticipated
        10.9 percent year-over-year drop in global cocoa production, plummeting

        The future of cocoa production—and by extension, the global chocolate
        industry—hinges on an effort to support sustainable farming practices.
        To help mitigate the current supply crunch, the Ghana Cocoa Board
        advised farmers to utilize what it terms the "4Ps"—Pruning, Pollination,
        Poultry Manure, and Protection. The initiative promotes regular pruning
        of cocoa trees to increase yield, innovative pollination techniques, the
        use of poultry manure for soil fertility, and enhanced protection
        against pests and diseases.
